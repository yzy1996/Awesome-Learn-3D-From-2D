The generator $G$ produces a synthesis image $G(\mathbb{z}, v)$ with a random noise $\mathbb{z}$ under a view label $v$.

The discriminator $D$ contains two parts $(D_s, D_v)$. $D_s$ estimates the image quality, i.e., how real the image is, $D_v$ predict the view of given image.



The encoder $E$ reconstructs a latent vector $\bar{\mathbb{z}}$ from an image, in other words, $E$ will be learned as an inverse of $G$ and the latent space could represent the total image space.

In this problem, the output of $E$ should preserve the same identity and we hope $E$ could disentangle the viewpoint from the identity.

To be specific, we first sample a pair of real images $(\mathbb{x}_{i}, \mathbb{x}_{j})$ which are the same identity but different views $v_i,v_j$. The goal is to reconstruct $\mathbb{x}_j$ from $\mathbb{x}_i$. To achieve this, $E$ takes $\mathbb{x}_i$ as an input and outputs an identity-preserved representation $\bar{\mathbb{z}}$ together with the view estimation $\bar{\mathbb{v}}$: $(\bar{\mathbb{z}}, \bar{\mathbb{v}}) = E(\mathbb{x}_i)$. $G$ takes $\bar{\mathbb{z}}$ and $v_j$ as input, then produce $\tilde{\mathbb{x}}_{j}$ which should be the reconstruction of $\mathbb{x}_{j}$. 



在第一轮训练中，训练 $G$ 和 $D$， $G$ 想尽可能生成与真图像的假图，$D$ 想尽可能分辨出真图和假图。 

$\{D_s(\mathbb{x}), D_s(G(\mathbb{z}, v))\}$ 和 $\{D_v(\mathbb{x}), v\}$ 差距要尽可能小

> 只能同时识别身份和角度，建立的是真图和假图之间的关系，还缺乏同一身份不同角度真图或者假图之间的关系

在第二轮训练中，训练 $E$ 和 $D$，希望弥补上面的缺陷，$E$ 想尽可能解码出身份信息和角度信息，所以只要解开了，$G$ 就能继续生成，但 $D$ 需要重新训练别让把相同身份不同位置的

**key words**: 

> Pose-Invariant Face Recognition (PIFR); 

**Problem:** 

> solve the problem of pose-invariant face recognition (PIFR), the goal is to extract the identity representation that is exclusive or invariant to pose and other variations.

**Related work:** 

> existing PIFR methods can be group into two categories - 1) employ face frontalization to synthesize a frontal face and then use traditional face recognition methods. 2) learn features directly from the non-frontal face.

**Impact:**

> help law enforcement practitioners identify suspects

**Main method:**

> - the input of $G_{enc}$ is **a face image** of any pose; the output is **a feature representation**.
> - the input of $G_{dec}$ is **a feature representation** above, **a pose code** $c$, and **a random noise vector** $z$; the output of $G_{dec}$ is **a synthetic face image** at a target pose
> - $D$ is trained to not only distinguish **real vs. fake** images, but also predict the **identity and pose** of a face.

**Mainly including three features:**

> - identity - represented by feature extracted by $G_{enc}$
> - pose - represented by pose code 
> - other facial feature (appearance variations) - represented by noise vector



The learning problem are twofold: 1) to learn a pose-invariant identity representation for PIFR, and 2) to synthesize a face image $\hat{x}$ with the same identity $y^d$ but a different pose specified by a pose code $c$.

The approach is to train a DR-GAN **conditioned** on the original image $x$ and the pose code $c$.



Given a face image with label $y = \{y^d, y^p\}$, where $y^d$ represents the label for identity and $y^p$ for pose. The discriminator $D = [D^d, D^p]$.

$\hat{x} = G(\mathbf{x}, c, z)$

**[`Defense-GAN: protecting classifiers against adversarial attacks using generative models`]**

**[`2018`]** **[`ICLR`]** **[[:memo:](./Defense-GAN.pdf)]** **[[:octocat:](https://github.com/kabkabm/defensegan)]**

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary><p>



**The main work:**

> To solve the problem of classification which is vulnerable to adversarial perturbations: carefully crafted small perturbations can cause misclassification of legitimate images. I can archive it into the field of **Machine deception**. (small perturbations do not affect human recognition but machine classifier)
>
> I can summarize their work as follows: given a picture with deception, GAN is used to generate the picture without deception, and finally classifier is used to classify.
>
> They use the GD of reconstruction error ($ \|G(\mathbf{z})-\mathbf{x}\|_{2}^{2} $) to find optimal $ G(z) $ 

**The methods it used:** 

- [ ] Several ways of attack: Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Randomized Fast Gradient Sign Method (RAND+FGSM), The Carlini-Wagner (CW) attack
- [ ] Lebesgue-measure

**Its contribution:**

> They proposed a novel defense strategy utilizing GANs to enhance the
> robustness of classification models against black-box and white-box adversarial attacks

**My Comments:**

> This work can be referred to using AE (Auto Encoder) for noise reduction. It’s just an easy application of GANs.
