Fourier Features Let Networks LearnHigh Frequency Functions in Low Dimensional Domains

Implicit neural representations with periodic activation functions

SIREN replaced the popular ReLU activation function withsine functions with modulated frequencies, showing greatsingle scene fitting results.







The major drawback of training coordinate-MLPs with raw input coordinates is their sub-optimal performance in learning high-frequency content. 

**As a remedy**, recent studies empirically confirmed that projecting the coordinates to a higher dimensional space using sine and cosine functions of different frequencies allows coordinate-MLPs to learn high-frequency information **more effectively**.
