核心是 implicit neural representations



与之能结合的是：



#### 组成式（也就是多个物体的表征和生成）

- [GIRAFFE: Representing Scenes as Compositional Generative Neural Feature Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12100) (Niemeyer et al. 2021)
- [Object-centric Neural Rendering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08503.pdf) (Guo et al. 2020)



#### 生成式（主要是和GAN的结合）

for 3D-aware

- [Generative Radiance Fields for 3D-Aware Image Synthesis](https://autonomousvision.github.io/graf/) (Schwarz et al. 2020)
- [pi-GAN: Periodic Implicit Generative Adversarial Networks for 3D-Aware Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00926) (Chan et al. 2020)
- [Unconstrained Scene Generation with Locally Conditioned Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00670.pdf) (DeVries et al. 2021) 



for 2D

- [Adversarial Generation of Continuous Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12026) (Skorokhodov et al. 2020)
- [Learning Continuous Image Representation with Local Implicit Image Function](https://github.com/yinboc/liif) (Chen et al. 2020)
- [Image Generators with Conditionally-Independent Pixel Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13775) (Anokhin et al. 2020)
- [Alias-Free GAN](https://nvlabs.github.io/alias-free-gan/) (Karras et al. 2021)



#### 泛化性

- DeepSDF, Occupancy Networks, IM-Net concurrently proposed conditioning via concatenation.
- [Pifu: Pixel-aligned implicit function for high-resolution clothed human digitization](https://shunsukesaito.github.io/PIFu/) (Saito et al. 2019) proposed to locally condition implicit representations on ray features extracted from context images.
- [Scene Representation Networks: Continuous 3D-Structure-Aware Neural Scene Representations](https://vsitzmann.github.io/srns/) (Sitzmann et al. 2019) proposed meta-learning via hypernetworks.
- [MetaSDF: MetaSDF: Meta-Learning Signed Distance Functions](https://vsitzmann.github.io/metasdf/) (Sitzmann et al. 2020) proposed gradient-based meta-learning for implicit neural representations
- [SDF-SRN: Learning Signed Distance 3D Object Reconstruction from Static Images](https://github.com/chenhsuanlin/signed-distance-SRN) (Lin et al. 2020) show how to learn 3D implicit representations from single-image supervision only.
- [Learned Initializations for Optimizing Coordinate-Based Neural Representations](https://www.matthewtancik.com/learnit) (Tancik et al. 2020) explored gradient-based meta-learning for NeRF.
